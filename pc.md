## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is an open source distributed control system that allows you to manage and keep track of your source code history.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git allows you to manage and track code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to manage git repos.
3. Why do we create a branch?
We use brances to isolate work without affecting other branches.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull requests allow you to tell others the changes you have pushed to a branch in a repo on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
cd .. and then cd main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: downloads commits, files, and refs from remote repo to local repo
git merge: puts forked history back together to make a single branch
git pull: updates local version from remote repo, updates current local working branch, updates remote tracking branch.
7. What is a merge conflict?
This happens when you merge branches with competing commits and git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You have to manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.
